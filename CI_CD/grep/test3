My day starts at 7 o’clock. I take a shower, wash my face, brush my teeth and get dressed. After that I have breakfast. Then I take a school bus and go to school.

Lessons start at 8 o’clock. The first lesson is Mathematics. We study numbers and figures. It’s boring, but the teacher is very kind and funny. The next lesson is Literature. We read books for children. My favourite book is Alice in Wonderland.

The third lesson is History. There we study history of the world. It is interesting, because you can learn something new. I like to read about English kings and queens.
